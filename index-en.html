        <p class="description">
            It was like that. There used to be an old, post-German house with a
            garden, where we used to spend every summer vacation for our kids.
            In the 90s, the parents managed to buy it back and arrange it
            beautifully. After 30 years, however, it required a general
            renovation. So we locked ourselves in it for one winter and in fact
            we created anew, doing everything ourselves.<br />
            <br />

            The neighbor here is the Wolin National Park, and the most frequent
            guests are roe deer peeking through the windows. With a bit of luck,
            you will spot the majestic white-tailed eagle on our oaks. There are
            also old forests, the highest cliffs and ... Vikings. And although
            we are separated from the island by over 600 km, we have our own
            Stop Alaska - with the most beautiful and wildest part of the Polish
            sea.<br />
            <br />

            Isn't it worth seeing with your own eyes?
