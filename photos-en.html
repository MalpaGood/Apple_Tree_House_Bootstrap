            Lubin, the place where we will host you, was written about in the
            12th century. The Lusatian culture played a significant role even
            earlier. But if you really want to travel back to the times that
            made the biggest impact on this place, it's time to put on thick
            jackets and woolen socks: the next stop in the Ice Age. It was then
            that the Wolin island we know today was born: full of lakes, hills,
            wild beaches and the highest cliffs in Poland. <br />
            <br />
            We invite our guests to our former German house with its own garden
            and ecological orchard. In order to fully enjoy the peaceful
            breakfasts, at which the world does not bother unnecessarily, we
            rent the place exclusively. <br />
            <br />
            Two bedrooms (one is also a living room due to a sofa and a table
            with chairs) can accommodate a total of 4 people. There is also a
            well-equipped kitchen with a dining area, a bathroom with a bathtub
            and a washing machine, a small terrace and the aforementioned garden
            with fruit trees. <br />

            If you like cooking while on vacation, you will find here almost
            everything you need to create culinary masterpieces. We took care of
            such details as a citrus juicer (imagine breakfasts in the garden
            with homemade orange juice ...), glasses of all sizes and ointments,
            beautiful tableware and a grill. Coffee lovers can feel taken care
            of: they will find both an overflow coffee machine and a pressure
            coffee maker on site. <br />
            <br />
            However, if you prefer to avoid the pots from a distance during your
            rest, you will easily find a few nice restaurants just by a plate's
            throw. <br />

            And can you be bored in the land of 44 islands? With the Wolin
            National Park, which starts just a few steps from the gate? And a
            viewpoint on the Szczecin Lagoon and the backwaters, only 200 meters
            away? <br />
            <br />
            For those who love swimming, we recommend renting a boat or a kayak.
            Since you've already arrived here, it's worth jumping a bit further
            north and seeing the sunset over the sea (it's only a quarter of an
            hour by car!). In Międzyzdroje itself there is also a long pier,
            wide beaches and sweet buns that make your fingers sticky. In
            summer, the Festival of Stars is held here, tempting with various
            performances, concerts and exhibitions. <br />
            <br />
            We encourage all those who like to lose their breath, take a walk
            along the blue hiking trail. The trail goes quietly through the old
            forest (the average age of the local trees is over 100 years), until
            it suddenly turns and ends at the cliff. However, if you take the
            road the other way, towards Wapnica and further to Międzyzdroje, you
            will also find here some scenic hills, as well as the Turquoise
            Lake, a remnant of the chalk mine. <br />
            <br />
            As the history of Wolin Island is full of battles, fights for
            influence, and legends of former power, it is easy to find echoes of
            the past here. Even we ourselves, during the renovation of the
            bathroom, completely by accident and an accident with a collapsed
            floor, we discovered a basement hidden under the house. In the area
            you will find other old houses, around which several dozen years
            ago, the Germans would walk and take out family souvenirs hidden
            there earlier. Or maybe even treasures? <br />
            <br />
            Half an hour from Lubin there is the Center of Slavs and Vikings. It
            is worth visiting the local open-air museum or see the
            demonstrations of old crafts. If you come to us with a dog, he will
            also be welcome in the Center (lead on a leash is obligatory). Every
            year, a festival is held here, during which you can see
            reconstructions of battles, eat delicacies from forgotten recipes
            and listen to Slavic music. There is a climate! <br />
            <br />
            And when you see all these wonders, put out the sun loungers in the
            quiet garden, uncork the good wine. And relive this day in your
            mind, so that you can always come back to it. <br />
